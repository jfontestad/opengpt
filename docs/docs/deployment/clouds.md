# Clouds

!!! info "NOTE:"
    If you want to use `dstack` alone, it's enough to start the Hub server locally using
    the [`dstack start`](../reference/cli/start.md)
    command. It will allow you to run dev environments, pipelines, and apps both locally
    and in the cloud.
    
    However, if you want to work as a team and manage cloud credentials in a more secure way, you may consider
    deploying the Hub server into your cloud.

Currently, the easiest way to deploy the Hub server to your cloud is by using the [Docker](docker.md) image.

!!! info "NOTE:"
    More detailed instructions on how to deploy to each specific cloud, including the Terraform templates and instructions
    for deploying via Kubernetes, will be coming soon.
