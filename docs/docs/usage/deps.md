# Deps

By using `deps` workflows can reuse artifacts from other workflows. There are two methods for doing this: by specifying
a workflow or tag name.

## Workflows

Let's create the following workflow YAML file:

<div editor-title=".dstack/workflows/deps.yaml"> 

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: cat-txt-2
    provider: bash
    deps:
      - workflow: hello-txt
    commands:
      - cat output/hello.txt
```

</div>

If we run it, it will print the contents of the output artifacts of the last run of the `hello-txt` workflow.

!!! info "NOTE:"
    Make sure to run the [`hello-txt`](artifacts.md) workflow beforehand.

## Tags

Tags can be managed using the `dstack tags` command.

You can create a tag either by assigning a tag name to a finished run or by uploading any local data.

Say, you ran the [`hello-txt`](artifacts.md) workflow, and want to reuse its artifacts in another workflow.

Once the [`hello-txt`](artifacts.md) workflow is finished, you can add a tag to it:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack tags add txt-file grumpy-zebra-2
```

</div>

The `txt-file` here is the name of the tag, and `grumpy-zebra-2` is the run name of the
[`hello-txt`](artifacts.md) workflow.

Let's reuse the `txt-file` tag from another workflow:

<div editor-title=".dstack/workflows/deps.yaml"> 

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: cat-txt
    provider: bash
    deps:
      - tag: txt-file
    commands:
      - cat output/hello.txt
```

</div>

!!! info "NOTE:"
    You can create also a tag by uploading arbitrary local files. To do this, use the `dstack tags add` command 
    with the `-a PATH` argument, which should point to the local folder containing local files.

## External repos

By default, `dstack` looks up tags and workflows within the same repo.

If you want to refer to a tag or a workflow from another repo,
you have to prepend the name (of the tag or the workflow) with the repo name.

The workflow below uses a tag from the `dstackai/dstack-playground` repo:

<div editor-title=".dstack/workflows/deps.yaml"> 

    ```yaml
    workflows:
      - name: cat-txt-3
        provider: bash
        deps:
          - workflow: dstackai/dstack-playground/txt-file
        commands:
          - cat output/hello.txt
    ```

</div>

!!! info "NOTE:"
    Make sure to run the `hello-txt` workflow in the `dstackai/dstack` repo beforehand.
